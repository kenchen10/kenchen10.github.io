            Our <a class="links3" href="interactive_webpage/index.html">[supplementary webpage]</a> is meant to accomodate the "What is HDR?" paper by showcasing still frames from HDR video stimuli used in our user study. HDR content was tested in Google Chrome on a Macbook Pro M3, and can only be viewed accurately on an HDR display.
