# Welcome to Jekyll!

# This config file is meant for settings that affect your whole blog, values
# which you are expected to set up once and rarely edit after that. If you find
# yourself editing this file very often, consider using Jekyll's data files
# feature for the data you need to update frequently.
#
# For technical reasons, this file is *NOT* reloaded automatically when you use
# 'bundle exec jekyll serve'. If you change this file, please restart the server process.

# If you need help with YAML syntax, here are some quick references for you:

# Site settings
# These are used to personalize your new site. If you look in the HTML files,
# you will see them accessed via {{ site.title }}, {{ site.email }}, and so on.
# You can create any custom variable you would like, and they will be accessible
# in the templates via {{ site.myvariable }}.

  Welcome! I am a first year Computer Science PhD student at New York University where I am currently 
  advised by <a class="links" href="https://qisun.me" target="_blank">Prof. Qi Sun</a> 
  in the <a class="links" href="https://www.immersivecomputinglab.org/" target="_blank">Immersive Computing Lab</a>. 
  Recently, I've been really interested in making XR displays more power-efficient. 
  <br><br>
  I graduated with a BA in Computer Science from UC Berkeley, where I pursued research under 
  <a class="links" href="https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~sequin/" target="_blank">Prof. Carlo H. SÃ©quin</a>. 
  I was also a TA for <a class="links" href="https://cs184.eecs.berkeley.edu/sp21" target="_blank">Computer Graphics & Imaging</a>,
  and VP of Tech at <a class="links" href="https://www.innovativedesign.club/" target="_blank">Innovative Design</a>.
  <br><br>
  Outside work, I like taking <a class="links" href="images.html" target="_blank">photos</a>, swimming, 
  and playing video games.
  <br><br>
  Feel free to reach out about research or anything else!

research: My current research interests intersect computer graphics, VR/AR, applied perception, and displays. <br> (Representative papers are <span class="highlight">highlighted</span>, <em>*=equal contribution</em>)
