  abstract: "There has recently been an explosion of interest in creating large-scale shared virtual spaces for multiplayer content. However, rendering player-controllable avatars in real-time creates latency issues when scaling to thousands of players. We introduce a human audience video dataset to support applications in deep learning-based 2D video audience simulation, bypassing the need for background 3D virtual humans. This dataset consists of YouTube videos that depict audiences with diverse lighting conditions, color, dress, and movement patterns. We describe the dataset statistics, our implicit data collection strategy, and audience video extraction pipeline. We apply deep learning tasks on this data based on video prediction techniques, and propose a novel method for 2D audience simulations."

  abstract: "Untethered VR/AR HMDs can only last 2-3 hours on a single charge. Toward resolving this issue, we develop a real-time gaze-contingent power saving filter which modulates peripheral pixel color while preserving visual fidelity. At SIGGRAPH 2023, participants will be able to view a short panoramic video within a VR HMD with our perceptually-aware power saving filter turned on. Participants will also have the opportunity to view the power output of scenes through our power measurement setup."
